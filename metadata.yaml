description: 'No other narrative account of Abraham Lincoln''s life has inspired such
  widespread acclaim as Lord Charnwood''s Abraham Lincoln : a biography. Many contemporary
  historians consider this thorough and superbly crafted work the quintessential biography
  of one of America''s greatest presidents. Written by a native of England and originally
  published in 1916, the biography is a rare blend of beautiful prose and profound
  historical insight. Charnwood''s study of Lincoln''s statemanship introduced generations
  of Americans to the life and politics of Lincoln, and the author''s observations
  are so comprehensive and well supported that any serious study of Lincoln must respond
  to his conclusions. This is essential reading for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln,
  the Civil War, or American political history.'
